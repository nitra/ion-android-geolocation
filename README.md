# ion-android-geolocation

The `ion-android-geolocation` is a library built using `Kotlin` that provides geolocation features for Android applications.

The `IONGLOCController` class provides the main features of the Library, which are:
- obtaining the location/position of the device a single time;
- adding a watch to obtain periodic location updates;
- clearing/removing a previously added watch, turning off location updates.

## Motivation

This library is used by the Geolocation Plugin for [OutSystems' Cordova Plugin](https://github.com/ionic-team/cordova-outsystems-geolocation) and [Ionic's Capacitor Plugin](https://github.com/ionic-team/outsystems-geolocation).

## Usage

In your app-level gradle file, import the `ion-android-geolocation` library like so:

```
    dependencies {
    	implementation("io.ionic.libs:iongeolocation-android:2.2.0")
	}
```

## Methods

As mentioned before, the library offers the `IONGLOCController` class that provides the following methods to interact with:

### Obtain the current location of the device

```kotlin
suspend fun getCurrentPosition(
    activity: Activity, 
    options: IONGLOCLocationOptions
): Result<IONGLOCLocationResult>
```

The method is composed of the following input parameters:
- **activity**: the `Activity` from the app using the library to use when obtaining the location.
- **options**: `IONGLOCLocationOptions` with the options with which to make the location request with (e.g. timeout).

The method returns a `Result` containing either an object of type `IONGLOCLocationResult`, which includes the geolocation data (e.g. latitide, longitude), or an exception that should be handled by the caller app.

### Add a watch for periodic location updates

```kotlin
fun addWatch(
    activity: Activity,
    options: IONGLOCLocationOptions,
    watchId: String
): Flow<Result<List<IONGLOCLocationResult>>>
```

The method is composed of the following input parameters:
- **activity**: the `Activity` from the app using the library to use when obtaining the location updates.
- **options**: `IONGLOCLocationOptions` with the options with which to make the location updates request with (e.g. timeout).
- **watchId**: a unique id identifying the watch to add, so that it can be removed later.

The method returns a Flow in which the location updates will be emitted to.

### Clear a watch that was added previously

```kotlin
fun clearWatch(id: String): Boolean
```

The method is composed of the following input parameters:
- **id**: the `watchId` identigying the watch to remove.

The method returns a Boolean indicating if the watch was cleared or not (in case the watch isn't found).

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:

1. Location updates not received
   - Check that location permission is allowed on the device
   - Verify location services are enabled on the device
   - Ensure the necessary permissions are included in `AndroidManifest.xml`

2. Poor accuracy
   - Enable high accuracy mode
   - Ensure clear sky view
   - Wait for better GPS signal

3. Error received when in airplane mode
   - Try setting `IONGLOCLocationOptions.enableLocationManagerFallback` to true - available since version 2.0.0
   - Keep in mind that only GPS signal can be used if there's no network, in which case it may only be triggered if the actual GPS coordinates are changing (e.g. walking or driving).

4. Timeout received in `watchPosition`
    - Use the `IONGLOCLocationOptions.interval` parameter, introduced in version 2.1.0, and set it to below `timeout`, in order to try to receive a first location update before timing out.
    - Increase the `IONGLOCLocationOptions.timeout` value, if your use case can wait for some time.
    - Increase `IONGLOCLocationOptions.maximumAge` to allow to retrieve an older location quickly for the first update.
